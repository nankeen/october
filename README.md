# October Kernel

This is a project to learn about kernels and operating systems.
The kernel will boot using GRUB/QEMU as I think writing a bootloader and a kernel would be too daunting of a task.
Simply because the switch from 16 bit real mode to 32 bit protected mode is rather tedious.
However there are plans to write a simple bootloader.

I named this October simply because I started the project in late October.
